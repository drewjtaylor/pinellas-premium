# Pinellas Premium LLC

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What is Pinellas Premium LLC?

Pinellas Premium LLC is the name of an actual lawn company owned by a friend of mine.

Their current website can be found [here](https://www.pinellaspremium.com/)

## Project goals

My goal is not necessarily to make an exact copy, but this website should at least maintain the same functionality. The aesthetics of the site do not need to be the same.

## Pages

### Home page

The home page will have some kind of carousel to showcase some of the main photos, as well as main information about the company

### About us

The "About Us" page has more information about the company, but also has a button that leads to a contact form. On the contact form, the user fills out their contact information. Information to contact the company resides on this page as well.

### Lawn Maintenance

This page lists their specific services. Beneath each service description is a button to order, which also leads back to the contact page.

### Landscaping

This page describes more in detail some of the auxilliary landscaping services offered.

### Other services

Extra services that didn't fit anywhere else can be found on this page.
